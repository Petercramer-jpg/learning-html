    <b> What It's All About<br><br></b>
  <body>
    <p>Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspapers and
    magazines?</p>
    <p> More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by
    makers of calendars, postcards, for advertisements, and for illustrating
    books, stories and articles?</p>
    <p>This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the question: "How can I make my camera-work profitable?"</p>
    A. H. Beardsley,<br>
    Publisher, Photo-Era Magazine.
    <p>At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services." But professional photographers do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.</p>
    <p>No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought from amateur photographers in towns no larger than the average, and sometimes smaller.</p>
    <p>The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa in order to produce photographs that will sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett says, himself a success at selling his photographs:</p>
    <blockquote>"The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular events that focus the attention of the world now and then. <em> This is a delusion. The real triumph is that of the photographer who utilises the material ready at hand in his own district, be it large or small."</em></blockquote>
